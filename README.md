Satellite Water Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Features. This project explores multiple approaches — from Random Forests on SVD-compressed grayscale images to CNN feature extraction with XGBoost — for classifying satellite images from the EuroSAT dataset to detect water bodies like lakes and rivers.
